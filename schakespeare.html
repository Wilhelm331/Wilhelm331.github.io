    <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</h1>
</strong>

<p><i> by William Shakespeare</i></p>
<br>

<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
<br>
Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate</strong>:
<br>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
<br>
And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>:
</p>

<p>
    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
    <br>
    And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
    <br>
    And every fair from fair sometime declines,
    <br>
    By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimme'd:
</p>

<p>
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
    <br>
    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
    <br>
    Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
    <br>
    When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
    <br>
        So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
        <br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
        <br>
